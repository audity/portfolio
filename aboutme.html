      Friday nights always finds me in front of my laptop.
      <br> <br> 
      Either working on a project or playing a video game, I can garuntee you that I will be up until the deepest crevices of the morning.
      Five hours of sleep has never held me back and there will never be enough time in a day to complete all of my goals.
